A daily guessing-game similar to Wordle, but for specific albums. Takes inspiration from [GAMEDLE](https://www.gamedle.wtf/#)'s Guess mode. \
The [website](https://jeffrey-remy.github.io/guessthealbum/) is publicly accessible and is published using Github Pages.

## Repository

This Git repository stores the frontend for the website, developed with React. \
The backend is implemented in Google Cloud via a simple Node app and SQL database.
